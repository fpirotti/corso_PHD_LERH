# Fast intro to R

We will learn here to use R for some basic operations.

## R + RStudio 

R is a scripted language providing all functionalities of a programming language by attaching libraries to C/C++/Fortran compiled code. 

The scientific community provides many added functionalities that are available on packages that can be installed (see later)

RStudio is an IDE (development environment). Also available in the cloud (RStudio-Server) if you like to have all your data on the cloud. 



## BELOW SOME BASICS R



### Structures

Try to run the following lines 
```{r warning=F, echo=T, comment=F, eval=F}
character
integer
double
numeric
list
vector
array
matrix
data.frame
```
 

### Basic math

```{r}
4+4
2**3 ## this is javascript-style
2^3
## remember ANGLES are in RADIANS
sin(90/180*pi) 

```

### Assigning values to variables

Use the ```<-``` operator or ```<<-``` if you want to go up of scope (see later)


```{r}

greeting <- "Hello class!"
print(greeting)
print(greeting[[1]])

age <- 28 # Numeric variable
name <- "Frank" # Character variable
# logical values TRUE or FALSE
do.I.like.this.course <- TRUE # logical variable
# 
do.I.like.this.course == F

#' Vectors - simple list which can have a SINGLE TYPE of element
#' (all numeric, character ....)
myRange <- c(2,3,4,20,0)
print(myRange)

#' many operations are serialized over the vectors, therefore:
myRange/3

#' you can print ranges easily
myRange <- 2:50
print(myRange)

#' and print their length
print(length(myRange))

#' OR with a function called "seq"
myRange <- seq( 10, 100, 5)

#' See what happens if you mix types
myRange <- c(2,4, "pippo")
print(myRange)

#' If you want to mix, use lists
myRange <- list(234, 0.55, "pippo")

#' Vectors and lists are "named", you can access by name or position
print(myRange[[3]])

#' Our list does not have names yet
names(myRange)

#' Let's name our list
names(myRange)<- c("Nome 1", "Valore 2", "Nome")
print(myRange[["Nome 1"]])
print(myRange[[1]])


```

### Factors 

Factors are a smart way that R uses to create classes:

```{r}

countries <- c( rep("Italy", 4000), rep("Germany", 2000), rep("China", 1000), rep("India", 1000)  )

#' See how many for each class are available
table(countries)
#' You can save your info in RDA files, which 
#' can be loaded back easily  
save(countries, file="countries.rda")

countries.factors<-as.factor(countries)
levels(countries.factors)
save(countries.factors, file="countries.factors.rda")
#' Check SIZE difference of file!
file.size.difference <- file.size("countries.rda") / file.size("countries.factors.rda")
message("File with factors is " , round(file.size.difference, 2), "X smaller than file with full characters")

```

### Special variables and indexing vectors

```{r}

#' NA is Not Available and means a missing value
#' NaN is "not a number" and can appear
print(0/0)

#' NAs can be detected:
myRange <- 1:20
myRange[c(4,6,8)] <- NA
#' a T/F bitmask - 
print(is.na(myRange))

#' to get the index of the values you are looking for
na.idx<-which(is.na(myRange))
print(na.idx)

#' Substitute NAs with zeros
myRange[na.idx]<-0

#' and back but with NaN
zero.idx<-which(myRange==0)
myRange[zero.idx]<-NaN
print(myRange)


```


### Objects

"Objects" is a generic term for an element in R, they can be a function, a variable, a list, etc...   
 
You can check if they exist and what class they belong to. Classes define object properties and allow object-oriented programming. For example the "plot" function will behave differently if a "raster" object is given as an argument or if a vector object is given as argument.    

```{r}
#' Objects loaded in the workspace (see also 
#' Environment panel in RStudio)
objects()

#' you check if objects exist, in this case we 
#' use a String, not the variable
exists(countries)
exists("countries")

#' you can REMOVE objects, in this case we can 
#' use the variable OR the string with the name
rm(countries)
exists("countries")

#' You can load data back in your workspace from the RDA file
load("countries.rda")
exists("countries")

#' countries is a vector if characters, therefore the whole vector is a "character" class
class(countries)

#' also function objects have  a class
class(class)

```
### Functions  

Functions "do" things. They are provided with one or more "arguments", which are defined inside the parenthesis and are used inside the function.

Functions RETURN either nothing or some object. 

```{r}
#' The function below takes an argument called "rocket.name", which 
#' has a default value (if user calls the function without the argument)
launch.rocket <- function(rocket.name="LoVe"){
  
  message( "Launching rocket " , rocket.name)
  Sys.sleep(1)
  
  random.message <- sample(c(" launched"," crashed", " is waiting", " currently under maintainance"), 1)
  
  message("Rocket " ,  rocket.name, random.message)
  return(random.message)
}

result<-launch.rocket()
result<-launch.rocket("PhD")
print(result)

```


## How to get help 

Let's get some help about a function we want to know about.  
R packages almost always provide examples for each function, so you can learn easily new tools!

```{r}
 
?terra::rast
??terra::vect

```


## ASSIGNMENT
 
Create a range of **50 odd numbers** starting from the day of your birth, then apply a simple math function to  make them all even numbers above 100.  For example if you are born the 10 of May, you will create a vector { 11, 13, 15, ... 109 } and then apply a function to convert them into 50 even numbers all above 100.

Hand in your code - you can upload your R script file in your folder in Google drive.
